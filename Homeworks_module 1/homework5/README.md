# HOMEWORK # 5 :blue_book:

1. How do private, public and protected modifiers work in Ruby?
2. How can I do to set the initialize method, so it works receiving optional
arguments?
3. Create a Student class with the following components:

    * Instance attributes: full name, address, phone, age
    * A class attribute with the name of the university
    * The initialize method
    * Only reader accessors for all the attributes
    * A method that returns true if the student is underage
    * A method that returns true if the studentâ€™s age is more than 27
    >The code is here [ Student class :mag_right:](###)
