     >The code is here [ Even odd number :mag_right:](evenOdd.rb)
2. Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number, using
iteration.
    >The code is here [ factorial number with iteration :mag_right:](iteractiveFactoria.rb)
3. Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number, using
recursion.
    >The code is here [ factorial number with recursion :mag_right:](recursiveFactorial.rb)
4. Write a function that returns true if a given number is prime, and false
otherwise.
    >The code is here [ Prime number :mag_right:](PrimeNumber.rb)
5. Write a function that receives a string and an integer number,
returning an array which contains the words of that string whose size is
greater that the received number.
   >The code is here [ Words bigger than number :mag_right:](words.rb)
